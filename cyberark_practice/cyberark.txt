ch-11: PSM Must be domain joined.
PSM:(Isolation,control,monitoring): Why PSM is required?

    manual Account onboarding(without psm)
        -java is required.-on lower version(classic UI)
        -this will be browser base connection, but this is not secure.
        -if user is making connection from his system to the target server, port needs to be open from host to remote, so if we have 500 user'secure
         then port need to open on every machine.
        -PTH signature left on the browser, which is prone to hacking(not secure)
        -there is no monitoring
ch-12:
PSM:
    Isolation: isolate workstation / desktop from the target machine, thus preventing cyberark attack.
    Control: ensure accountablity and control over privilege session with live monitoring,policies,workflow.
    Monitoring: Recording of each seesion with compliance in mind with zero footprint on the target system.

Prerequisites:
    Microsoft server
    capacity-will be cover in another chapter

Installation:

Post Installation Environment:
    users:
        PSMConnect:A windows user that is created in order to start PSM session on the PSM machine.
        PSMAdminConnect:A windows user that is created in order to monitor live privilege session.
        PSMShadowUsers: An internal group that contains local PSM users. The PSM creates a local
                        PSM user called "PSM-<user-id>, the user-id will be some unique, random numbers" for each Vault user who connects to the PSM
                        and automatically adds these local users as members to this internal group.
    Safes:
        PSM: This contains the password of the unique PSM user.
        PSMLiveSessions:This will enable users to view the PSM live monitoring feature in an environment with multiple PVWAs.
        PSMNotification: to send email notification.
        PSMUnmanagedsessionaccounts: this will enable users to view the PSM secure connect page and connet to any machine through PSM using any connect,
                                     including those that are managed in the vault.
        PSM Universal Connectors : All connectors added to this safe will be deployed to all the PSM servers automatically (with optional exception*).

    
    Users created in vault:
        PSMGW_<MachineName>:This is the Gateway user through which the PSM users will access the Vault. The credentials file for this user is PSMGW_<MachineName>.ini.
                            This user is added automatically to the following group: PVWAGWAccounts,Being a member of this group with enable this user to access all 
                            password Safes.
        PSMApp_<MachineName>:This user is used by the PSM for internal processing. The credentials file for this user is PSMApp_<MachineName>.ini. 
                             This user is added automatically to the PSMAppUsers group.
    Groups:
        PSMAppUsers:This group is used to retrieve configuration from the Vault, create Recording Safes and upload recordings, and perform other PSM activities, 
                    as well as defining the authorizations that are required by the PSM internal users. The PSMApp_<Machinename> user is added automatically to 
                    this group. It has the Audit Users and AddSafes authorizations in the Vault, and is automatically added to the Recordings Safe with all 
                    authorizations.
        PSMMaster:This group manages the Safes where recordings are stored. It is added to the Recordings Safes with all authorizations. PIM Administrators can be
                  added to this group so that they can manage Recording Safes or, alternatively, users or groups can be added separately with relevant permissions.
        PSMLiveSessionTerminators:Members of this group can terminate live privileged sessions, based on their individual Safe ownership.

#PSM:PAM Administration:
1. Privileged Session Manager (PSM)
    • PSM Ad-Hoc Connections
    • PSM via HTML5 Gateway
    • PSM for Windows

        PSM Flow:
            1. Logon through PVWA
            2. Connect to PSM using RDP/TLS
            3. Fetch credential from Vault
            4. Connect using native protocols
            5. Logs forwarded to SIEM and PTA
            6. Store session recording

        Enable PSM: Master Policy:
            Policies->Master Policy -> Session Management
        
        PSM by Platform:
            Platform Management->Target Account Platform ->Privilege Session Management->ID=PSMServer
            -By default, Platforms are associated with the first installed PSM server

        PSM Connection Components/Connectors:
            Connection Components(aka Connectors) define the configuration settings for using a given third-party client to connect to a target platform.
                A few common ones are:
                • SQLPlus
                • RDP
                • Putty
                • WinSCP
            options-connectioncomponents
                Platform Settings:
                    To enable the use of a particular third-party client to connect to a given account, the appropriate Connection Component needs to be assigned to the Platform
                    that manages that account
        Importing and Managing Connectors:
            The new interface accelerates and simplifies Vault administration by allowing admins to import PSM connectors and link them to Platforms, all from one location

    PSM Ad-hoc Connection:
        With an Ad-Hoc Connection,users can connect securely to any machine supported by the PSM if they know the password.
        • Main use cases:
            ⎼ Connecting with accounts that are not stored in the CyberArk Vault
            ⎼ Connecting with personal accounts
        Provides all the benefits of PSM: isolation, monitoring,and recording

        Enable Ad-hoc Connections:
            • The PSM Secure Connect Platform must be activated
            • Privileged session monitoring and isolation must be enabled for the PSM Secure Connect platform. This can be done either globally or via an exception to the Master policy.

        Launch Ad-hoc Connection:
        Users will need to specify all the account details when they connect:
            • The Client they want to use on the PSM (winscp,ssh)
            • Target system Address
            • Username
            • Password, etc.

    • PSM via HTML5 Gateway:
        HTML5 Gateway: Overview
            • Many organizations block RDP client connections from end-users' machines for security reasons or regulatory requirements.
            • RDP is a Microsoft protocol, so in order to use it in Linux, Unix, or MAC environments,users must install a 3rd-party client in order to connect to the PSM.
            • The HTML5 Gateway tunnels the session between the end user and the PSM proxy machine using a secure WebSocket protocol (port 443). This solution eliminates the need
                to open an RDP connection from the end user's machine. Instead, the end user only requires a web browser to establish a connection to a remote machine through PSM.
            • Secure access through HTML5 requires integrating an HTML5 gateway on a Linux server (can be co-hosted with PSM for SSH). The Gateway is based on Apache Guacamole.
        
        HTML5 Gateway: Flow
            1. Logon through PVWA and click onConnect
            2. Connect to HTML5 GW usingWebSocket
            3. Connect to PSM using RDP
            4. Fetch credential from Vault
            5. Connect using native protocols
            6. Logs forwarded to SIEM and PTA
            7. Store session recording

        Enable HTML5 Gateway:
            The HTML5 GW is enabled at the system level for each PSM server
            option-privilege session manager-configure PSM server
        Use HDML5-based or RDP-file Connection Method:
            • Users can be given the option to connect either an HTML5-based or RDP-file connection method when connecting to the remote server
            • This setting is applied at the Connection Component level

    How It works:
        PSM HTML5 Gateway is based on Integrates Guacamole software . Guacamole has ability to convert the https session to rdp session , when user click on the connect button 
        a new tab is open , the Guacamole service then connect with the rdp to the psm server which is responsible for retriving the credential from the vault and establishing
        the connection to the target.
        end result is connection to the target in the browser.

    Prerequisites:
        pvwa 10.1 and above
        psm version 9.2 and above
        HTML5 gateway : Linux server can be installed on psm ssh proxy server.
    Configuration : Set Up Gateway
        set up the gateway on the linux server by completing the following steps:
            take care of required libraries(including java).
            Install HTML5 WebApp (like Tomcat)
            Install the Guacamole deamon called guacd
            Harden the gateway
    Configuration in pvwa:
        option-configured psm gateway server, in each psm administration-psm-configured psm server -psm gateway

    HTML5 is working from version 11.2 onwords.

 IMP:   To became visible in pvwa:
        psm-rdp-use parameter-display name and visible should be yes.


    • PSM for Windows :Flows
            1. Connect to PSM using RDP/TLS
            2. Fetch credential from Vault
            3. Connect using native protocols
            4. Logs forwarded to SIEM and PTA
            5. Store session recording

--------------------------------------------------------PSM SSH Proxy-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. PSM for SSH:
PSMP:
    The Privileged Session Manager SSH Proxy (PSMP) enables organizations to secure, control and monitor privileged access to network/*NIX devices (only SSH protocol).
	The PSMP is installed on a dedicated machine that has access to the Vault and to the target systems.
    Connections are not launched via the PVWA,but through a special connection string.

PSM for SSH: Overview:
    • The average enterprise manages hundreds of Unix servers and network devices
    • Systems are usually critical, but access to them is uncontrolled
    • Network and Unix teams are reluctant to change their existing workflows and tool sets
    • PSM for SSH (previously PSM SSH Proxy orPSMP) is designed to provide a native Unix/Linux user experience when connecting to any SSH target system

PSM for SSH: Flow
    1. User opens SSH session to the PSM server
    2. PSM retrieves privileged account password from the vault
    3. Open SSH session to the target using the privileged account
    4. Logs forwarded to SIEM and PTA
    5. Store SSH session audit

-----------------------------------------------AIM(Application Identity Manager)--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hard Coded credentials:
    Clear text credentials in code:     its very command for developes to put credential in code as clear text,what is easy for developes , is easy for attacker too.
    Configuration files and databases:  Hard-coded credentials are also commonly found in config files, application databases, windows registry etc.
    Service Accounts:                   Services running in the background in a given day/week? Those service accounts can provide access to highly sensitive data,
                                        yet they are often protected by hard-coded credentials.
    Application servers:                Organizations deploy applications on application servers(WebLogic, JBoss, WebSphere, Tomcat).
                                        Credentials are required by these applications, to access systems such as databases, and are often hard-coded into the application server configuration.
                                        And lastly, many organizations have third party applications such as risk and compliance management, availability and recovery management, and IT automation and management
                                        where there are hard-coded credentials. Such systems must use Privileged credentials to carry out their inherent purpose.
                                        For example, a vulnerability management system must have the ability to scan all machines on the network and assess their vulnerabilities.
                                        To do that, it needs a privileged credentials, which is often hard-coded into the application code.
AIM Solutions:
    cp
    CCP 
    ASCP(application server credential provider)

CCP:    The Central Credential Provider consists of the Credential Provider for Windows that is installed on an IIS server and the Central Credential Provider web service, 
        used by calling scripts/applications to retrieve credentials during run-time. 
        Passwords that are stored in the CyberArk Digital Vault can be retrieved to the Central Credential Provider, where they can be accessed by authorized remote applications using web service calls. If 
        these passwords are managed automatically by the CPM, the Vault makes sure that the passwords in the Central Credential Provider are constantly synchronized with the corresponding passwords in the Vault.
        Applications that require credentials to access a remote device or to run another application remotely can request the relevant credentials from the Central Credential Provider using the Central 
        Credential Provider web service.

Administration Practice:
    Policies:Platform:Safe:accounts

    1-Policies: Master Policy  
        a-Privilege Access Workflow
        b-Password Management
        c-seesiomn management
        d-audit
    2-Platform: platform have three main functions:
        a-Technical setting for managing password: passwortd policy setting such as minimum length , forbidden character and so on.
        b-connecting to the target system:points to the relevent plugins and connection component.
        c-The basis for exceptions to the master policy
            Platform Types:
                1-Targets: define the techinical settings that determine how the system manages accounts on diffrent type of server.

                2-Dependents: also known as usages:
                    define additional service accounts such as windows service or schedule tasks

        platform managements:
            in order to configure platform, you need to be a member of vault admin group.otherwise you will not see the administratioon menu, which is where 
            you find platform management.

        Edit Platform:
            Platform are divided in to 2 broad sections:
                1-UI and workflows
                2-Automatic Password Management
