Instance Metadata with Userdata:
	in aws there is a magaic ip address and by the help of magic ip address with could fetch the metadata through api.
	curl 169.254.169.254
	curl 169.254.169.254/latest
	dynamic
	meta-data
	curl 169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data
	curl 169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ami-id
	if it ends with "/" it means, its a directory and someting in it.
Question: where we use this, suppose we need instance id from user data:
		#!/bin/bash
		instance_id=$(curl curl 169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ami-id)
	to get the dynamic data:
		curl 169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document
	to get public ip address:
		curl 169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4
	to get private ip address:
		curl 169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4

VIMP: this will work in case of when we do the below setting:
	Go to EC2 > Instances > Select Instance > Actions > Instance Settings > Modify Instance Metadata Options > IMDSv2. If the setting is set to Required, change it to Optional". This will allow the curl command to get the instance metadata.

	Elastic Block Storage (EBS) | Instance Store
		Elastic block storage is online storage attch to any instance over the network.
		EBS volume is alos multiple type. io1 and io2 can be attached to multiple instance.
		if you create a ebs volume in created a availability zone ap-south-1a , then you can attach the same with the instance which is created in the same availability zone.
		when you create ebs volume , aws by default create a replica within the same availability zone.
		we can move the esb storage to another availaility zone with the help of snapshot.
	Instance store:
		it is temprory storage.data will be lost after stop.
