Instance Metadata with Userdata:
	in aws there is a magaic ip address and by the help of magic ip address with could fetch the metadata through api.
	curl 169.254.169.254
	curl 169.254.169.254/latest
	dynamic
	meta-data
	curl 169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data
	curl 169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ami-id
	if it ends with "/" it means, its a directory and someting in it.
Question: where we use this, suppose we need instance id from user data:
		#!/bin/bash
		instance_id=$(curl curl 169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ami-id)
	to get the dynamic data:
		curl 169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document
	to get public ip address:
		curl 169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4
	to get private ip address:
		curl 169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4

VIMP: this will work in case of when we do the below setting:
	Go to EC2 > Instances > Select Instance > Actions > Instance Settings > Modify Instance Metadata Options > IMDSv2. If the setting is set to Required, change it to Optional". This will allow the curl command to get the instance metadata.
