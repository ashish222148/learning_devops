AWS Cloud Formation:
    Script and Tool : every polular thing based on these two thing.
        terraform,ansible platform agnostic but cloud formation is platform dependent(aws).

        Cloud formation is the automation tool for infrastructure creation from Script.
            1-EC2 creation (values) script: also called stack(what i need)
            2-Handover to cloudformation
            3-permission
create json file for creating ec2 instance
create iam role for cloud formation
add ec2 full permission to that role

we can also delete the stack.

Bootstrap script in EC2:
    go to advance:-user data
        #!/bin/bash
        yum install httpd -y
    
    another way: terraform to provision infra, with the help of jenkins run playbbook on ec2 instance -first need to create the build

Security Groups:
    -A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your instance to control inbound and outbound traffic.
    -when you launch an instance in a vpc ,you can assign up to five securuty group to the instance.
    -security groups act at the instance level, not the subnet level.
    -each instance in a subnet in your vpc can be assigned to a diffrent set of security groups.
    -you can only specify allow rules but not deny rules.
    -you can specify seperate rules for inbound and outbound traffic.
    -security group rules enable you to filter traffice based based on protocols and port numbers.
    -security groups are stateful-if you send a request from your instance, the response traffice is allowed to flow 
    -in regardless of inbound security group rules  and vice versa.

ELB:- ELB is a managed service of AWS. You don't need to worry about its scalability and high availability.
        a-high availability
        b-load balancing
    -Elastic load balancer distributes incoming application traffic across multiple ec2 instances, in multiple availability zones.
    -The load balancer serve as a single point of contact for clients , which increases the availability of your application.
    -you can add or remove instance from load balancer as your need change, without disruption of overall flow of requests to your application.

ELB terminology:
    Listener:
        you configure your load balancer to accept incoming traffic by specifing one or more listner.
        a listner is a process that checks for connection requests.
        it is configured with a protocol and port number for connections from the load balancer to the targets.
    Target Group:
        Elastic Load Balancing supports four types of load balancers: ALB, NLB, GLB and CLB.
        There is a key difference between the ways you configure these load balancers. With ALB, NLB and GLB, you register targets in target groups, 
        and route traffic to the target groups and With classic load balancers, you register instance with the load balancer.
    AZs and LB Nodes:
        When you enable an Availability Zone for your load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing creates a load balancer node in the Availability zone.
        If you register targets is an Availability zone but do not enable the Availability zone, these registered targets do not receive traffic.
        Note that your load balancer is most effective if you ensure that each enabled Availability zone has at least one registered targets.

Types of Load Balancer:
    Network Load Balancer:
        Network Load Balancer in AWS takes routing decisions in the Transport layer (TCP/SSL) of the OSI model.
        It can handle millions of requests and a sudden spike of traffic because it works at the connection level.
        Best for same kind of content available on app/web servers.
    Application Load Balancer:
        An Application Load Balancer in AWS makes routing decisions at the application layer (HTTP/HTTPs) of the OSI model, thus the name Application Load Balancer.
        ALB supports path-based and host-based routing.
        It chooses the best target possible for the type of load and sends to the target with the highest efficiency.
    Gateway Load Balancer:
        Gateway Load Balancer makes it easy to deploy, scale, and run third-party virtual networking appliances. 
        Providing load balancing and auto scaling for fleets of third-party appliances, Gateway Load Balancer is transparent to the source and destination of traffic. 
        This capability makes it well suited for working with third-party appliances for security, network analytics, and other use cases.
    Classic Load Balancer:
        Classic Load Balancer provides basic load balancing across multiple Amazon EC2 instances and operates at both the request level and the connection level. 
        Classic Load Balancer is intended for applications that were built within the EC2-Classic network.
        Supports host based routing
1. Health checks:
        An Elastic Load Balancer only routes traffic to healthy targets such as EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, micro services, Lambda functions, and appliances.
        With Elastic Load Balancing, you get improved insight into the health of your applications in two ways: (1) health check improvements that allow you to configure
        detailed error codes. The health checks allow you to monitor the health of each of your services behind the the load balancer; and (2) new metrics that give insight 
        into traffic for each of the services running on an EC2 instance.
2. Sticky sessions:
        Sticky sessions are a mechanism to route requests from the same client to the same target. Elastic Load Balancers support sticky sessions. 
        Stickiness is defined at a target group level.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Route-53-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DNS: 
    convert url to ip addresses
How Does DNS Route traffic to your web application:
    1-A user opens a web browser, enters www.example.com in the address bar, and presses Enter.
    2-The request for www.example.com is routed to a DNS resolver, which is typically managed by the user's Internet service provider (ISP), 
        such as a cable Internet provider, a DSL broadband provider, or a corporate network.
    3-The DNS resolver for the ISP forwards the request for www.example.com to a DNS root name server.(.-->root domain)
    4-The DNS resolver for the ISP forwards the request for www.example.com again, this time to one of the TLD name servers for .com domains. The name server 
        for .com domains responds to the request with the names of the four Amazon Route 53 name servers that are associated with the example.com domain.
    .com , .in, .edu etc are the TLD, top level domains.
    5-The DNS resolver for the ISP chooses an Amazon Route 53 name server and forwards the request for www.example.com to that name server.
    6-The Amazon Route 53 name server looks in the example.com hosted zone for the www.example.com record, gets the associated value, 
        such as the IP address for a web server, 192.0.2.44, and returns the IP address to the DNS resolver.
    7-The DNS resolver for the ISP finally has the IP address that the user needs. The resolver returns that value to the web browser. 
        The DNS resolver also caches (stores) the IP address for example.com for an amount of time that you specify so that it can respond more quickly 
        the next time someone browses to example.com. For more information, see time to live (TTL).
    8-The web browser sends a request for www.example.com to the IP address that it got from the DNS resolver. This is where your content is, for example,
     a web server running on an Amazon EC2 instance or an Amazon S3 bucket that's configured as a website endpoint.
    9-The web server or other resource at 192.0.2.44 returns the web page for www.example.com to the web browser, and the web browser displays the page.

Note: Image Attached.

Route53:
    go to hosted zone, add ailiya222148.in 
        two records created bydefaults:
            NS:(Name server):tells what are the authorative server, (authorative keeps the information about where the request will be , means from name to ip resolver)
            SOA:(Start of authority):all the details of your domain resides in this record.

            create record:
                A- route traffice to an IP address and some aws resource
                CNAME-route traffic to amother domain name(load balancer)
            nslookup ashish222148.in (to check whether the value entered in a name is reflecting or not)
            nslookup ashish.ailiya222148.in(to check whether the value entered in a cname is reflecting or not)
            nslookup -type =cname ashish222148.in
        
        Note: Cname can only be used as subdomain not as domain
            even if you want to create A record as a domain , then use alias. this is also recommanded by aws.

    Amazon Route53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service.
    It is designed for developers and corporates to route the end users to Internet applications by translating human readable names like www.mydomain.com, 
    into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0.2.1 that computers use to connect to each other.
    AWS guaranties 100% availability for Route 53.
    It’s designed to work closely with other services like EC2, S3, Cloudfront, etc.
    You can automate DNS management along with instance provisioning.
Route53 Features:
    Domain registration – Amazon Route 53 lets you register domain names such as example.com.
    Domain Name System (DNS) service – Amazon Route 53 translates friendly domains names like www.example.com into IP addresses like 192.0.2.1. 
    Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries using a global network of authoritative DNS servers, which reduces latency.
    Domain Registration - A domain is the name, such as example.com, that your users use to access your application.
    Availability monitoring - Health checks monitor your applications and web resources, and direct DNS queries to healthy resources.
Route53 Hosted Zone:
    A hosted zone is a container for records, and records contain information about how you want to route traffic for a specific domain, 
    such as example.com, and its subdomains (acme.example.com, zenith.example.com). A hosted zone and the corresponding domain have the same name. There are two types of hosted zones:
    There are two types of hosted zones:
    1. Public hosted zones contain records that specify how you want to route traffic on the internet.
    2. Private hosted zones contain records that specify how you want to route traffic in an Amazon VPC.
Route53 Routing Policy:
    1. Simple Routing Policy"
        Most used when you create a new Record set.
        When there is a single resource doing the function for the domain for e.g., web server that serves content for the website www.krnetworkcloud.org.
        AWS Route 53 responds to the DNS queries based on the values in the resource record set for e.g., IP address in an A record.
    2. Failover routing
        Failover routing lets you route traffic to a resource when the resource is healthy or to a different resource when the first resource is unhealthy.
        The primary and secondary records can route traffic to anything from an Amazon S3 bucket that is configured as a website to a complex tree of records.
        The Route 53 you have two records, one for primary and other for secondary.
    3. Latency Based Routing Policy
        Latency based routing allows you to route your traffic based on the lowest network latency for end user (Which region will give them the fastest response time).
        Latency-based routing policy can be used when there are multiple resources performing the same function and Route 53 needs to be configured to respond to the DNS 
        queries with the resources that provide the fastest response with lowest latency.
        Latency resource record set can be created for the EC2 resource in each region that hosts the application. When Route 53 receives a query for the corresponding domain, 
        it selects the latency resource record set for the EC2 region that gives the user the lowest latency.
    4. Weighted Routing Policy
        Weighted routing policy enables Route 53 to route traffic to different resources in specified proportions (weights) for e.g., 75% one server and 25% to the other during a pilot release.
        Weights can be assigned any number from 0 to 255.
        Weighted routing policy can be applied when there are multiple resources that perform the same function for e.g., webservers serving the same site.
        Weighted resource record sets let you associate multiple resources with a single DNS name.
    5. Geolocation Routing Policy
        Geolocation routing policy enables Route 53 to respond to DNS queries based on the geographic location of the users i.e., location from which the DNS queries originate.
        Restrict distribution of content to only the locations in which you have distribution rights.
        Geolocation routing policy allows geographic locations to be specified by continent, country, or by state (only in US).
        Two geolocation resource record sets that specify the same geographic location cannot be created.
    6. Multi-value Answer Routing Policy
        Multi-value answer Routing Policy is like Simple Routing Policy, but it can return multiple IP addresses associated with an FQDN.
        There is more than one resource record for the same FQDN, pointing to different IP addresses, load balancer etc.
        DNS queries return the result in random order, which means that when you query next time, the IP address corresponds to the FQDN is in different order or sequence.

DNS Registration in Route53
    1. Registering domain using amazon route53
        Use Amazon route53 to search for a new domain you are interested in registering.
        Amazon route53 supports a large number of TLDs, including both generic TLDs, and Geographic domains.
        When you register a domain, Amazon route53 will automatically create the hosted zone for your domain.

    2. Transferring domains to amazon route53
        You can transfer domain registration from another registrar, for supported TLDs to amazon route53 or from one AWS account to another.
        Transferring your domains into route53 allows you to manage all of your domains in the same place as your name servers and hosted zones.
