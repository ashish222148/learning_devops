# this is linux notes.

To check the password policy of system:
    cat /etc/login.defs

what is group?
	Group is collection of user accounts, group is very useful for system administrator to manage permission number of users.

Types of group:
1-primary group:
    this group account create and delete automatically with user account operations.
2-secondry group account:
    secondry group account create and delete by privilege users.

group account database
1-group account properties: /etc/group
2-group admin properties: /etc/gshadow

steps to manage group account:
    crate group account:
        groupadd ailiya
    check group properties:
        grep accountgroup /etc/group

modify group id:
    groupmod -g 2020 ailiya
add single member in group:
    gpasswd -a arun ailiya
remove single member from group
    gpasswd -d arun ailiya
add/remove multiple users in a group:
    gpassd -M user1,user2
make group admin:
    gpasswd -A arun ailiya
delete group account:
    groupdel accountant

----------------------------------------------------------------Permission--------------------------------------------------------------------

Permission:
1-basic permission
2-acl permission  - Access control list
3-special permission

1: Basic Permission:
    basic permission is flexiable to manage.
    we can assign permission to user , group and other.

    to check permission of a file:
        ls -l ./note.txt
    to check permission of directory:
        ls -ld /directory
    
    if lrwxrwxr-x , means start with l , then neither its file nor folder its basically shortcut of any application/file/folder

    How to add permission:
        chmod o+rw /test
        o=other
        g=group
        u=user
        chmod o-r-x /test
        chmod g+rwx /test
        or chmod 766 /test

        remove all permission from user,group and other
            chmod u-rwx,g-rwx,o-rwx /test
            or
            chmod ugo-rwx /test
        add all permission from user,group and other
            chmod u+rwx,g+rwx,o+rwx /test
            or
            chmod ugo+rwx /test

    change the owership of file and folder
        chown ashish:ailiya ./notes.txt
    only owner change:
        chown ashish ./notes.txt
    only group change 
        chgrp ailiya ./notes.txt

2-ACL: Access Control list:
    ACL permission use for provide permission to specific user or group
    to check ACL:
        getfacl /test

    set ACL permission to user:
        setfacl -m u:arun:rx test
        setfacl -m u:arun:7 test

    modify ACL permission:
        setfacl -m u:arun:6 test

    remove ACL permission from user:
        setfacl -x u:arun:  test

    remove all ACL permission at a time:
        setfacl -b test

    set ACL permission to group:
        setfacl -m g:ailiya:7 test

    remove ACL permission permission of group:
        setfacl -x g:miowner: test
Note: we can also explicilty remove permission from a user whether user have already by default permission

3-Special Permission:
    special permission design for executable file and directories.

    It divied in to three parts
        1-SUID (Set User ID)
        2-SGID  (Set Group ID)
        3-Sticky bit
    

    SUID:when we set suid permission on any executable file then any can ran/execute that file as a owner.
        for set suid:
            chmod u+s /usr/bin/nmtui
        for remove suid:
            chmod u-s /usr/bin/nmtui
        result:dsrwr-xrw- like that, s donates suid, if s is in small case , then it means x is present, else if its S, x is not available

        note: result will be any command will be run by any user once we set this.
    SGID:
        when we set gid permission on any directory then that directory group ownership inherited on child file/directories

        for set sgid:
            chmod g+s /tcs
        for remove sgid:
            chmod g-s /tcs

    sticky bit:
        when we set sticky bit permission on any directory then contents inside that directory can only delted by user.
        it is popularly for publically shared directory

        for set sticky bit
        chmod o-t /database

    special permission with number:
        u+s=4
        g+s=2
        o+t=1

    set suid:
     chmod 4755 /usr/bin/su
     chmod -4000 /usr/bin/su

    ls -ld /test
    chmod u+s /test

    s=small  case , then x is also present

    S= capital case, then X is absent

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regular expression:
    Regular expression is process of search file/dir based on matching pattern such as name,owner,group ownership
    permission size etc.
    following command popularly use in Regular expression-

    1-grep
    2-find
    3-head
    4-tail
    5-wc

    1-grep (gloal Regular expression print)
        it is basically search in the content of file.
        vim /home/linux.txt
        linux is secure owership
        linux was developed by linus torvald
        linux is fast
        windows and linux os both are popular

        1-search secure keyword
        grep secure /home/linux.txt

        2-search secure keyword in multiple file
        grep secure /home/linux.txt /etc/password /etc/group

        3-show matched file name(list)
        grep -l secure /home/linux.txt /etc/passwd /etc/group

        4-show unmatched file name (list)
        grep -L secure /home/linux.txt /etc/passwd /etc/group

        5-show matched line number:
        grep -n secure /home/linux.txt

        6-show match counting
        grep -c os /home/linux.txt

        7-incase senstive search:
        grep -i linux /home/linux.txt

        8-show inverse result:
        grep -v secure /home/linux.txt

        9-line starting with given keyword
        grep ^linux  /etc/linux.txt

        10-line ending with given keyword
        grep os$ /etc/linux.txt

        11-search recursively
        grep -r linux /home/

        12-redirect search result in to file
        grep secure /home/linux.txt > /info.txt

        13-append search result in to file:
        grep os /home/linux >> /info.txt
        
    2-find:
        find command use for serach file / dir on basis of name,owner ,groupowner,permission,size etc.

            a-serach with name:
                find /home -name linux.txt
            b-seach with owner:
                find / -user ashish
            c-seach with groupownerhip:
                find / -group tatagroup
            d-seach with permission:
                find /usr -perm 4755
                find /usr -perm 2755
                find /usr -perm 777
            e-seach basis on size
                find / -size -10M(less than 10 MB)
                find / -size +100M(greater than 100MB)
                find / -size +50M -size 100M(greater than 50 less than 100 MB)
