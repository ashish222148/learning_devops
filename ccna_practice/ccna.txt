OSI Model: Open System Interconnection , developed by ISO in 1984.
    it has 7 layers.
        1-application-layer7
        2-presentation-layer6
        3-seesion-layer5
        4-transport-layer4
        5-network-layer3
        6-data link-layer2
        7-physical-layer1

Top 3 layesr is- software layer, handled by application, network,data link and physical-hrdware layer
transport layer is herat of OSI.

1-Application layer: provide an interface to interact with network. for example-web browser, email client
        there are some protocol which works on application layes.
        for example: http,https,ftp,telnet,ssh,smtp,pop,imap,dns,dhcp etc 

2-Presentation layer:data present in to correct format, so hat a user or an application can understand.
    it also provide encrption and decryption
    compress and decompression of data.

3-Session layer:create maintain and terminate the session

4-Transport layer:
    1-segmantation
    2-sequencing and reassemble on receiving 
    3- providing end to end connection.
    4-retransmission.
    -acknowjedge

    data cut in to small pices known as chunk.
    two protol is being used.
    TCP/UDP

    transmission control protocol: it is connetion oriented protocol
    user datagram protocol: connection less protocol
    tcp is reliable proocl whereas udp is unreliable protocl.
    tcp provides acknowledge and in udp no acknowledgement
    tcp is a slow protol and udp is fast protocol. 
    tcp uses 20-60 byte header while udp uses 4 bype header.
