RAS: Remote Access services

    RAS allows remote users to connect through wide area network (WAN) link to RAS server; from there RAS allows those clients to access resources on network.
    To allow a user to connect remotely to the RAS server , user should have the dial in permission.
    RAS uses NAT(translating your private ip address to public) and VPN:

LAB:
    DC:
        ip:                 10.0.0.1
        subnet mask:        255.0.0.0
        default Gateway:    10.0.0.2
        pdns:               10.0.0.1
        adns:               10.0.0.50

    RAS:
    NIC-1
        ip:                 10.0.0.2
        subnet mask:        255.0.0.0
        default Gateway:    NA
        pdns:               10.0.0.2
        adns:               10.0.0.1
    NIC-2
        ip:                 11.0.0.1
        subnet mask:        255.0.0.0
        default Gateway:    NA
        pdns:               NA
        adns:               NA
    Client:
        ip:                 11.0.0.2
        subnet mask:        255.0.0.0
        default Gateway:    NA
        pdns:               11.0.0.1
        adns:               NA
