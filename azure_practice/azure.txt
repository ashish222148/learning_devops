1-----------------------------------------------1-Azure Architecture and Virtual Machine:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Hypervisor:A hypervisor is software that allows multiple operating systems to run concurrently on a single physical computer, creating virtual machines (VMs).

    Create Windows Based Azure VM:
        All Services->Compute->Virtual Machine
            Create Virtual machine:
                create resource group: we can check the bills of diffrent resource group.
            Run with Azure spot discount: unused capacity will be provided by azure
        Virtual Network (same as VPC in AWS)

        Resource group-ailiya
        virtual machine name-ailiya-public-vm
        virtual network-ailiya-vnet

        OS Disk: Azure storage
        we we stop any VM in Azure , except OS disk which is built from Azure Storage everything will be deleted because same has been assigned by the hypervisor 
        on top of physical hardware.

        platform managed key used in OS protection.
    Linux server:
    authetication method:
        ssh public key
        password
        ssh public key:
            generate new key pair,(created by Azure)
            use existing key stored in azure , (use same key pair)
            use existing public key(create on pur laptop, public key and private key)
            by help of putty .pem key will be converted in to .ppk-go to coversion-import .pem key


    High availabilty through Availability Zone: if you want to protect your resource in case of any failure of data center
        region->availability zone(min 3 )
    Azure availability zones enabled services are designed to provide the right level of resiliency and flexibility . they can be configured in two ways:
        zone redundant: with automatice replicaion across zone.(suppose we create a storage account so there will a option like zone redundant storage-zrs)
            all the data which we save will be available to all availability zone.
        zonal:with instance pined to specific zone(while creating vm, there will be option)
    Availability Set: fault doman(rac-3 max) update domain(max 20)

    Regional Pair:
        It is not necessary that in case of disaster recovery server should be in regional pair.
        these are predefined , we can't change it.
    
    WebSite Hosting on Azure Virtual Machine:
NOte: IE Enhanced security configuration :off -> else you get popup evry time when you open internet explorer.

    C:\inetpub\wwwroot\website  to load the website.


    Virtual Machine Extension:
        Azure Virtual machine extensions are small applications that provide post deployment configuration and automation task on azure.
            for example if a virtual machine requires software installation , anti virus protection or ability to run a script inside it, you can use a VM extension.

            create a VM:
#    User Datain Aws    :in advance section, select an extension to install -search custom script extension -configure custom script extension
                create storage account and create container and save the script file in that conatiner.
                Install-WindowsFeature -name web-server -IncludeManagementTools
