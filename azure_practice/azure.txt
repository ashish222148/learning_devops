1-----------------------------------------------1-Azure Architecture and Virtual Machine:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Hypervisor:A hypervisor is software that allows multiple operating systems to run concurrently on a single physical computer, creating virtual machines (VMs).

    Create Windows Based Azure VM:
        All Services->Compute->Virtual Machine
            Create Virtual machine:
                create resource group: we can check the bills of diffrent resource group.
            Run with Azure spot discount: unused capacity will be provided by azure
        Virtual Network (same as VPC in AWS)

        Resource group-ailiya
        virtual machine name-ailiya-public-vm
        virtual network-ailiya-vnet

        OS Disk: Azure storage
        we we stop any VM in Azure , except OS disk which is built from Azure Storage everything will be deleted because same has been assigned by the hypervisor 
        on top of physical hardware.

        platform managed key used in OS protection.
    Linux server:
    authetication method:
        ssh public key
        password
        ssh public key:
            generate new key pair,(created by Azure)
            use existing key stored in azure , (use same key pair)
            use existing public key(create on pur laptop, public key and private key)
            by help of putty .pem key will be converted in to .ppk-go to coversion-import .pem key


    High availabilty through Availability Zone: if you want to protect your resource in case of any failure of data center
        region->availability zone(min 3 )
    Azure availability zones enabled services are designed to provide the right level of resiliency and flexibility . they can be configured in two ways:
        zone redundant: with automatice replicaion across zone.(suppose we create a storage account so there will a option like zone redundant storage-zrs)
            all the data which we save will be available to all availability zone.
        zonal:with instance pined to specific zone(while creating vm, there will be option)
    Availability Set: fault doman(rac-3 max) update domain(max 20)

    Regional Pair:
        It is not necessary that in case of disaster recovery server should be in regional pair.
        these are predefined , we can't change it.
    
    WebSite Hosting on Azure Virtual Machine:
NOte: IE Enhanced security configuration :off -> else you get popup evry time when you open internet explorer.

    C:\inetpub\wwwroot\website  to load the website.


    Virtual Machine Extension:
        Azure Virtual machine extensions are small applications that provide post deployment configuration and automation task on azure.
            for example if a virtual machine requires software installation , anti virus protection or ability to run a script inside it, you can use a VM extension.

            create a VM:
#    User Datain Aws    :in advance section, select an extension to install -search custom script extension -configure custom script extension
                create storage account and create container and save the script file in that conatiner.
                Install-WindowsFeature -name web-server -IncludeManagementTools
    How to delete Azure Resources:

-------------------------------------------------------------------2-Azure networking---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
under same Vnet all the subnet vm will be able to communicate.
    but there is firewall as well on OS level, which almost block the connectivity.
        1- solution: os level, allow incoming pending
        2-solution:switch off firewall

    firewall.cpl 
        turn off windows defender firewall
    private ip address assignment:
        static assignment
        dynamic assignment

    public ip address:(dynamic vs static assignment)
        public ip address can be create indendently as a resource.(like elastic ip address)
        public ip sku:
            1-basic-dynamic and static rest of all other option which exist in standard sku does not exist.
            2-standard-only static assignment is possible-availability zone-Tier-routing prefernce

    how to create a public ip:
        create public ip:
            IPv4 can be associate with any NI or load balancer while
            IPv6 can be only associated with load balanacer

            standard sku:
                availability zone:
                    no zone: microsoft create in any zone.
                    zone n: select zone if want to create any perticular zone.
                    zone redundant: public ip address will advertities in all three availability zone.
                Tier:
                    Global
                    Regional
                roting prefernce:
                    Microsoft network
                    internet
                idle timeout-inbound originated flow: 4-30 minutes
                dns name label

    Security Aspects of Public IP SKUs:
        Public IP Address Basic SKU: default open,less secure
        Public IP Address standard SKU: secure open,by default  
        to connect the standard sku-NSG

---------------------------------------------------------------Intersite connectivity---------------------------------------------------------------------

Add peering:(connection between two Vnet)
    traffic to remote virtual network
    traffic foprwarded from remote virtual network
    virtual network gateway or route server
    microsoft azure backbone network is being used in this case for traffic

Azure Vnet to Vnet Connetion :(connection between two Vnet):
    create gatewaysubnet with small range(name is by default and can not be changed)
    attach VPNGateway to this gatewaysubnet 
    same thing need to be implemented in second Vnet
    then establist the connection between VPNGateway1 to VPNGateway2 and visce versa
    here internet is used for traffic
Azure point to site (P2S) VPN overview: 
    User can connect to Vm through private network

Pont to site vpn deployment using certificate-
Q-How to connect VPN gateway with your Vnet:
    create gatewaysubnet with small pool of ip.
        create vpnsubnet by providing ip within gatewaysubnet.
        point to site connection
            it will ask for address pool -
                one ip from the same address pool will be provided to user laptop
                authetication type:
                a-azure certificate
                b-radius authetication
                c-azure active directory

                a-azure certificate:
                    root certificate-on VPNGateway
                    client certificate: on your pc 


Route Tables:
    System routes
    User Defined routes                    
creating user defind routes:
    create route Tables
    go to route Tables
    setting->route->add->route1-addressfix(destination)->virtual appliance->middle VM
    click on rt-subnet-associate-source subnet
    enable ip forwarding:go to middle subnet-> networking->network interface->ip configuration
    enable routing-on powershell run the below command: to the middle server
        set-itemproperty -path HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Tcpip\parameters -name ipenablerouter -value 1
        restart dmz
    to check route Tables
    on cmd 
    tracert destination ip

-------------------------------------------------------------------Azure Governanace---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Management Group:
    it manage the subscription, all the policy applied to the management group will be inherited automatically to the subscription.
    when we create any account in azure, a management group is automatically created, that is called Root Management Group.no one has intially access to root 
    management group.
    By default root management group's display name is Tenant Root Group.
    a user must assigned to owner or contributor role on role management group can only change the name of Tenant Root Group.

Azure Policy:

------------------------------------------------------------------Azure Entra ID----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Azure Entra ID:
    User ID and password will be created in azure Entra ID , intead of getting created on application local database.
    In this case Azure Entra ID will be the identity provider.

    Directory,Tenant and Subscription:
        when
